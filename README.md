Project Overview: ChickenEye - An Integrated Poultry Management System
Repository Location: https://github.com/creekcred/chickeneye

Objective:
Develop an advanced, integrated poultry management system to automate the monitoring, environmental control, and maintenance of a chicken coop, ultimately enhancing the welfare and productivity of the chickens.

Core Components:

Raspberry Pi 4B: Serves as the brain of the operation, executing software to control and coordinate the various subsystems.
Visual Monitoring: Utilizes cameras for constant surveillance, behavioral analysis, and QR code recognition to identify individual chickens and their egg-laying events.
Sense HAT: Gathers environmental data — temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure — to regulate the coop’s climate.
Water Regulation: Manages a water pump and filtration system to provide clean drinking water on demand.
Software Stack: Primarily Python-based, leveraging libraries like OpenCV for image analysis and Pyzbar for QR code scanning. Machine learning aspects are powered by frameworks such as TensorFlow to identify chickens and learn from their behavior patterns.
Functionality:

Tracking & Monitoring: Through camera feeds and QR code recognition, the system tracks which chicken lays each egg and monitors the health and productivity of the flock.
Environmental Control: Reacts to Sense HAT data to adjust coop conditions, maintaining an ideal environment for the chickens' health and egg production.
Water Management: Ensures water quality and availability through an automated pump and filtration system, minimizing the risk of contamination and disease.
Automation & Robotics:

Future expansions include the incorporation of a robotic arm for egg collection, using a custom-designed, CNC-fabricated end-effector to handle eggs delicately. This mechanism will place eggs into a basket, facilitating efficient and safe egg harvesting.
Software Development:

The system's software is open-source, encouraging community contributions and allowing for customization to fit various coop designs and scales. Python scripts, configuration files, and machine learning models are maintained within the GitHub repository.
Modularity & Scalability:

The architecture of the system is modular, allowing for incremental upgrades — such as the addition of automated feeding systems or integration with broader smart farm technology — without overhauling the existing setup.
Community & Contribution:

This project welcomes input from poultry experts, roboticists, environmental scientists, and hobbyists alike. The GitHub repository is the central hub for source code, issue tracking, feature requests, and collaboration on the development of the ChickenEye system.
